## Prerequisites

In order to utilize Visual Studio as a development environment for operating system development, you must first install the following pre-requisites

* Visual Studio 2022+
* [NASM 2.11.08](https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.11.08/win32/nasm-2.11.08-installer.exe)
* [i686-elf-tools](https://github.com/lordmilko/i686-elf-tools)
* [QEMU 2.8.50.0](https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w32/2017/qemu-w32-setup-20170113.exe)
* An assembly syntax highlighter, such as [AsmHighlighter](https://github.com/Trass3r/AsmHighlighter) (though you might have to compile it yourself)

**The versions of NASM and QMU to use are not suggestions. If you wish to use a newer version, I recommend at least verifying you can set breakpoints and step through assembly and C/C++ code with the recommended versions before upgrading**
